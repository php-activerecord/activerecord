# Basic CRUD

### Retrieve ###
These are your basic methods to find and retrieve records from your database.
See the *Finders* section for more details.

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
echo $post->title; // 'My first blog post!!'
echo $post->author_id; // 5

# also the same since it is the first record in the db
$post = Post::first();

# finding using dynamic finders
$post = Post::find_by_name('The Decider');
$post = Post::find_by_name_and_id('The Bridge Builder',100);
$post = Post::find_by_name_or_id('The Bridge Builder',100);

# finding using a conditions array
$posts = Post::find('all',['conditions' => ['name=? or id > ?','The Bridge Builder',100]]);
```

### Create ###
Here we create a new post by instantiating a new object and then invoking the `save()` method.

```php
$post = new Post();
$post->title = 'My first blog post!!';
$post->author_id = 5;
$post->save();
// INSERT INTO `posts` (title,author_id) VALUES('My first blog post!!', 5)
```

### Update ###
To update you would just need to find a record first and then change one of its attributes.
It keeps an array of attributes that are "dirty" (that have been modified) and so our
sql will only update the fields modified.

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
echo $post->title; // 'My first blog post!!'
$post->title = 'Some real title';
$post->save();
// UPDATE `posts` SET title='Some real title' WHERE id=1

$post->title = 'New real title';
$post->author_id = 1;
$post->save();
// UPDATE `posts` SET title='New real title', author_id=1 WHERE id=1
```

### Delete ###
Deleting a record will not *destroy* the object. This means that it will call sql to delete
the record in your database but you can still use the object if you need to.

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->delete();
// DELETE FROM `posts` WHERE id=1
echo $post->title; # 'New real title'
```
